Qt Event Dispatcher for libuv
=============================

The event dispatcher adds libuv as a supported backend
for Qt's event loop.

The build scripts are currently ommited from this repository
as it is currently included in [Qtjs Generator](http://github.com/svalaskevicius/qtjs-generator/)
as a submodule and is sharing its build setup. (This might change in
future.)
