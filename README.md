Qt Event Dispatcher for libuv
=============================

The event dispatcher adds libuv as a supported backend
for Qt's event loop.

The build scripts are currently ommited from this repository
as they are currently included in [Qtjs Generator](http://github.com/svalaskevicius/qtjs-generator/)
as a submodule and are sharing its build setup.

Please see `tests/features`, `tests/spec/` and `src/runner/` subprojects in qtjs-generator for the example build configurations.
